run command
> nano ~/.bash_aliases
add your alias
save file



> nano ~/.bashrc
double check if this piece of code exists

if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi

if it doesn't exists, add it




> source ~/.bashrc




then you would have any aliases added to be useable permanently and in-session without restarting
